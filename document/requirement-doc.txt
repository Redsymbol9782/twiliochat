project detail :  am working with Twilio to do Programmable Voice, SMS, Chat, Texting, Contact Center create communication channels and develop workflows and call functionality that you would normally do in a PBX.

customer will login from front-end and employee will be from back-end
There will be concept of SUPER ADMIN

admin will make employee and customer

so customer will login from front-end
super admin from back-end
customer can login and can see some public pages
employee and admin login from back-end

Look at https://www.solgari.com for video

Create ADMIN as super
ADMIN can create employee and customer
so 3 types of users would be there.

For CUstomer registration : 
location, first name, last name, number, email and password, area code , type of agent (sale or agent), It support (network support, application support, voice services Support) ,
those fields must be there.

Same as emplyee
customer will login from frontend and employee will be from backend
